# K-means-Clustering
K-Means clustering is the most popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm. K-Means clustering is used to find intrinsic groups within the unlabelled dataset and draw inferences from them. I have used Facebook Live Sellers in Thailand dataset for this project.

# Overall summary
In this project, I have implemented the most popular unsupervised clustering technique called **K-Means Clustering**.
I have applied the elbow method and find that k=2 (k is number of clusters) can be considered a good number of cluster to cluster this data.
I have find that the model has very high inertia of 237.7572. So, this is not a good model fit to the data.
I have achieved a weak classification accuracy of 1% with k=2 by our unsupervised model.
So, I have changed the value of k and find relatively higher classification accuracy of 62% with k=4.
Hence, we can conclude that k=4 being the optimal number of clusters.
